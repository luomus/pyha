																	<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Legislation and other reason for use restrictions</h5>
																	<p><a href="http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990621">The Act on the Openness of Government Activities (21 May 1999/621)</a>, Publicity Act is the most important legislation governing how data distributed through FinBIF is made less specific or secret.</p>
																	<p>Section 24 – Secret official documents, item 14: Documents containing information on endangered animal or plant species or the protection of important natural habitats, if access would compromise the protection of the species or the habitat;</p>
																	<p>Research data is not in principle open information and its use is often restricted for a certain time limit;</p>
																	<p>The data owner may, if he or she so wishes, limit the openness of his or her data, unless otherwise specified by law.</p>
																	<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Method</h5>
																	<p>Sensitive data or for other reason use-restricted data held by the Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility is protected either by making location data less specific or making the data secret. This is done automatically for species with sensitive data, and one-time for other restricted information.</p>
																	<p>However, a complete copy of the data is always taken and can be shared, for example for authorities or other use on a case-by-case basis.</p>
																	<p>A national list of species with sensitive data has been compiled and can be consulted at Species.fi:<a href="https://laji.fi/en/about/875">Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility – sensitive biodiversity data</a>. The list consists of species whose conservation would be endangered by data disclosure due to persecution, hunting, disturbance or commercial or hobby-based collection activities and the protection of information is based on the Publicity Act.</p>
